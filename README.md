# INTRO:
This project is about the Boston Celtics information management. There are ten tables and several
database objects (like procedure, functions, triggers). And this project also has a good UI for users 
to interface with the data from database. 

# Technical Specifications: 
I used MySQL workbench to achieve the database creation and operation. For the back-end, I used 
NodeJS (JavaScript) + ExpressJS to connect with my database. For the front-end, I used HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript to build a great UI for users to interact with back-end. There is no machine 
restriction for this project.

# README:
There are some steps to run this project: 
- Step 1: Open the file ‘project_create_command.sql’ to create the database (with no data) in your 
own workbench.
- Step 2: Dump the database into your own workbench (using “Li_final_project.sql”). And it contains 
all data and objects we will need.
- Step 3: Install node and npm. 
- Step 4: Use terminal to cd to the code file.
- Step5: Run ‘npm install’ to install all things we needed for this project (like express). And then run 
‘node app.js’ in the terminal.
- Step6: The terminal will ask you to input your database username and password. If it shows ‘server 
is running at 3000 port & success’, it means opening successfully.
- Step7: You need to go to ‘http://localhost:3000/’ to open this UI and input the username and 
password for this project (username: admin, password: cs5200). If this is correct, the website will 
go to the main UI for operations.
- Step8: Do some operations here!
